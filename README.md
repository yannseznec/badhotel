Pure Data based audio engine for the vaguely popular 2012 game Bad Hotel

These patches are pretty messy, and are unlikely to be cleaned up anytime soon.

The mothership patch for the whole thing is patches/main_audio.pd

Bad Hotel was an iOS game made by Lucky Frame. It's a sort-of tower defense game where you're actually building a tower (or rather, a hotel).
It's also a generative music game - all of the actions you take will dictate how the audio is generated, so each time you play you are creating new music.

It was nominated for lots of awards, including Best Audio at IGF, it won a BAFTA for best game at the Scottish BAFTAs, and was eventually ported to Android and PC to be part of a Humble Bundle.

Lucky Frame was Jonathan Brodsky, Yann Seznec, and Sean McIlroy.
